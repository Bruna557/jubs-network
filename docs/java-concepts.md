# Java Concepts

## Java Editions
- Java SE (Standard Edition): is the core Java programming platform. 
- Java platform EE (Enterprise Edition): differs from the Java SE in that it adds libraries which provide functionality to deploy fault-tolerant, distributed, multi-tier Java software, based largely on modular components running on an application server. 
- Java ME (Micro Edition) is the platform for developing applications for mobile devices and embedded system.

## Java Beans
JavaBeans are classes that encapsulate many objects (variables, data structures and methods) into a single object (the bean). A JavaBean is a Java class that should follow the following conventions:
- It should have a no-arg constructor.
- It should be Serializable.
- It should provide methods to set and get the values of the properties, known as getter and setter methods.

Basically, a JavaBean is a Java class which satisfies the above mentioned rules. The advantages of using Java Beans:
- The JavaBean properties and methods can be exposed to another application.
- It provides an easiness to reuse the software components.

```java
public class Employee implements java.io.Serializable {  
    private int id;  
    private String name;
  
    public Employee(){}
  
    public void setId(int id){ this.id=id; }
  
    public int getId(){ return id; } 
 
    public void setName(String name){ this.name=name; }  

    public String getName(){ return name; }  
}  

```


# Servlet
A servlet is a web component that is deployed on the server to create a dynamic web page. A servlet extends the capabilities of the servers and responds to the incoming requests. Think of a servlet as a tiny server whose job is to accept requests and issue responses.

Servlets could in principle communicate over any clientâ€“server protocol, but they are most often used with HTTP. Thus "servlet" is often used as shorthand for "HTTP servlet".

To deploy and run a servlet, a web container must be used. The web container is responsible for managing the lifecycle of servlets, mapping a URL to a particular servlet and ensuring that the URL requester has the correct access rights.
